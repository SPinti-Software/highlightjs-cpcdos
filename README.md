## What is CPCDOS?

### Preamble

CPCDOS is a co-kernel made for beginners in the OS development world, no knowledge in low-level programming required by implementing a language called CPCDOS C+, allowing developers to quickly write programs and tools and essentially a full distribution.

Resources about the operating system, tests, tutorials, etc. may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/cpcdososx)

### Implementation

CPCDOS sits on top of a DPMI server for the moment, although progress on independent code has been made during the last couple of years. The DPMI server is used mainly for filesystem operatins, networking & video display. 

### Example Code Snippet

See [/test/detect/default.txt](/test/detect/default.txt) for an example code snippet.
